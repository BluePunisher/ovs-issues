ovs-issues
==========

This repo is only used for issue tracking of Open vSwitch.  Since Github
does not allow issue-only permissions for projects, we have created this
repo with looser requirements for "write" permissions than we use for
the Open vSwitch core project.

The Open vSwitch code is stored in the "ovs" repo:

    https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs
